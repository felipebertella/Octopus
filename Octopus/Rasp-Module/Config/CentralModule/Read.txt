Octopus: Occupant-Centric Tool to Observe Practices of User and their Satisfaction

This project was created by Mateus Bavaresco with the goal to monitor internal environment variables and understand user's practices.

This part of the project was developed by Felipe Augusto Santos Bertella. It is responsible for the central module control, receiving data from
sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and storing it in a sqlite database.
